# DatabaseProject
This is my public repository for Database Projects
You preferably need mysql workbench in order to run this project.
Please refer the doc attached for conceptual designs, description of various tables, events, triggers, stored procedures, views, et al

If you don't want to install the work bench, a small client application is also provided that connects your database instance over AWS and runs the required queries.
